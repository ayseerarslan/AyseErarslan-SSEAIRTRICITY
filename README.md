## Energy Cost Estimator

Energy Cost Estimator is a Java-based project that aims to provide residents from UK with estimates of how much their electrical appliances cost to run. By leveraging the calculator from Citizens Advice, this tool helps users reduce energy costs and save money.

This project implements a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach from scratch to ensure the application meets the user requirements effectively. It leverages Java, JUnit, Selenium and Cucumber to automate the estimation process and provide a reliable tool for energy cost analysis.
